> nodejs-authentication is Nodejs based authentication mechanism. Users can register, login, logout, and display user profiles. The security mechanism is implemented with access tokens. Redis is responsible for holding these access tokens. When the user logged in to the system successfully, the application generates a secure access token and write to Redis with the user's data. After that application verifies the user's identity by using Redis. This increases application performance significantly.
